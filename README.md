# My first Java class

A program that models the concept of a person is required. A person has a first name, last name, ID number and year of birth. The class must have a constructor that initializes the values of its respective attributes.

## Part 1:
A program that models the concept of a person is required. A person has a first name, last name, ID number and year of birth. The class must have a constructor that initializes the values of its respective attributes.

The class must include the following methods:
Define a method that prints in console the values of the object's attributes.

Note: To print in console use System.out.println().

In the main method of the App class, two persons must be created and the values of their attributes must be displayed on screen.

## Part 2:
Add two new attributes to the Person class.
An attribute that represents the person's country of birth (String type) and another one that identifies the person's gender, which must be represented as a char with values 'H' , 'M', 'O'.
Modify the constructor of the Person class to initialize these two new attributes.
Modify the print method of the Person class to show the values of the new attributes on the screen.

### NOTE: The attributes of the Person class must be tested. Code in English.
